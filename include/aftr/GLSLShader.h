/**
   \brief A class that represents a Vertex Shader and Fragment Shader that can 
   be bound across one or more verticies.

   Each GLSLShader object has two parts... Shared data and per instance data. The shared
   data is stored in memory exactly once and is managed by the ManagerShader; this 
   is the fundamental data that does not ever change regardless of how it is 
   drawn. This includes things like the server side OpenGL handle, the filename 
   corresponding to that shader program, etc. This is owned 
   by the ManagerShader and should not be directly manipulated by the user without using 
   the ManagerShader's functions. This data is stored inside the GLSLShaderDataShared Object.
   There is a many-to-one mapping where many GLSLShader Objects map to a single 
   GLSLShaderDataShared. A GLSLShader Object has an internal pointer to a GLSLShaderDataShared Object.

   The per instance data is unique to this GLSLShader Object and is owned by this GLSLShader Object.
   This includes such things as this GLSLShader Object's GLSLUniforms and GLSLAttributes.
